# Dinfio Code of Conduct

This code of conduct applies to all members of Dinfio community, including all project maintainers and contributors.

- <b>Be friendly and patient</b>
- <b>Be welcoming</b> &mdash; We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, gender, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability
- <b>Be respectful</b> &mdash; Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. Itâ€™s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We should be respectful when dealing with other people
- <b>Be considerate</b> &mdash; Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions
- <b>Be careful in the words that you choose</b> &mdash; Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
    - Violent threats or language directed against another person
    - Discriminatory jokes and language
    - Posting sexually explicit or violent material
    - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing")
    - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms
    - Unwelcome sexual attention
    - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour
    - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing conduct@dinfio.org.
